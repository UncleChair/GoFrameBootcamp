Good job! You have finished the bootcamp! let's review again what we learned in this tutorial.

First, we installed all the dependencies and initialized our project:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="/web-server/installation" title="Installation" icon="document-text" subtitle="Set up your environment" >}}
  {{< card link="/web-server/initial" title="Initialization" icon="document-text" subtitle="Initial your project" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Then, we added a simple authentication service:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="/web-server/authentication" title="Authentication" icon="document-text" subtitle="Secure your server" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

And learned how to create a controller, add a service, bind a middleware and do `CRDU`:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="/web-server/authentication" title="Start with CRUD" icon="document-text" subtitle="Write your logic" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

Finally, we learned how to deploy our server:

{{< cards >}}
  {{< card link="/web-server/deploying" title="Deploying" icon="document-text" subtitle="Start your server" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

These are basically all you need to start your own project. There are many other features not mentioned in this tutorial, you can explore it in the [official documentation](https://goframe.org/display/gf)

Thank you for reading this tutorial.
